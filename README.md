# LogisimProcessingUnit
It's similar to FPGA,but it isn't FPGA.It's a new hardware emulator.
* We have something need to tell you.
1. We will upload the circuit diagram after some weeks.
2. Now,we have the instruction set and the emulator of LPU.
3. We are debugging the 32LA8-I instruction set and the emulator of it.
4. The README.md is incomplete.We hope someone can help us.If you want,please send an email to 13274913518@163.com.
